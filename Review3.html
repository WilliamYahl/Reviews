			<h1> Hades </h1>
			<p>Hades is a strange game for me. It’s oozing with charm, well written characters, and a fun story. I just don’t understand 
			why the game is a roguelike, As I play hades I see plenty of mistakes often found in bad roguelikes. difficulty comes from 
			bigger health bars, early levels become irrelevant as you level up, and you often find yourself creating builds and pushing 
			yourself in a specific direction rather than going with the flow and rolling with the punches. If you want a game with similar 
			mechanics I believe wizard of legend 1 (not 2), is a strictly better game. If you want to experience a story, I feel like Night 
			in the Woods would likely be a better experience. </p>
			
			<p>That being said, I don’t think Hades isn’t without praise. It blends genres beautifully, and when it needs to, It does tell 
			a very compelling story. Personally, although I'll admit that it’s not my cup of tea. It Isn’t a bad game whatsoever.</p>
