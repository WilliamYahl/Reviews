			<h1> Pizza Tower </h1>
			<p>Pizza Tower is a strange game, Its graphics seem crude at best, and with a casual playthrough only takes about an hour to 
			complete. Finally, the controls are clunky and hard to get a handle on. Despite all of this, Pizza tower is an incredible game. 
			The true beauty of Pizza tower is in how much effort you are willing to give it. The ways that these elements work together to 
			push you to try harder and Get better scores on the levels you already have, and the excitement that comes with perfecting a 
			level is unmatched</p>
			
			<p>While the graphics are crude, that doesn’t mean the graphics are bad. Everything in the game is hand drawn. The main character 
			alone has at least 5,300 different sprites that make up how he moves. I often found myself running around some in circles just 
			appreciating the art, and finding new sprites that only appear under specific circumstances. While the game looks crude and simple, 
			It doesn’t take long to realize just how much effort was put into the game, creating a rather unique style. </p>
			
			<p>Each level in Pizza tower can be completed in a few minutes, there is a simple path from beginning to end, the only difficult 
			thing is escaping, where you have a minute timer to play the entire level backwards. If you run out of time, you lose the level. 
			Each level is designed to be easy and fast, beatable within a minute. In exchange there are bonus objectives and collectibles 
			within each level, along with a point system that grades how much you achieved within the level. The real reward from each level 
			in pizza tower is grinding out the scores and pushing to get the best scores, and when you successfully finish a level and get a 
			high score, it’s an incredible accomplishment. </p>
			
			<p>The level design in pizza tower has a second quirk to it besides the scoring system. Most levels are simple. There’s rarely 
			any difficult obstacles in the level. The actual difficulty in the game is how unwieldy and chaotic your character is. Peppino 
			is easily a bull in a china shop, and doing anything with him is clunky and unwieldy. Figuring out how to control your character 
			is difficult, there are many different ways to simply move from point A to point B. Each method gives you momentum that pushes you
			toward point C, which is often a wall or a pit. But if you learn the character, you learn how to control where your moving and can
			barrel through entire levels in a blink of an eye. </p>
			
			<p>Out of all the objectives needed to complete a level, there’s one special one called the second lap. The second lap is easily
			the hardest objective, it only appears when you are rushing back to the beginning of the level, and when you beat the level. The 
			second lap will instead teleport you back to the end of the level, and it feels like you have just tempted fate. It’s now or never, 
			and you need to run for your life. As you play through the entire level again, with only 20 or 30 seconds left on the timer, It 
			feels exhilarating.  </p>
