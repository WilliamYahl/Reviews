			<h1> Hollow Knight Silksong </h1>
			<p>I started my journey with hollow knight along the time that the grimm troupe was added to the game, and I instantly fell 
			in love. Hollow knight is a game that completely resparked an entire genre of video games, and it deserves all of the praise 
			that it gets. </p>
			
			<p>Now that the 7 year wait is over, Silksong has been released. The question emerges, How good is it? How does it stand up 
			to Hollow Knight’s legacy? To be completely honest, I think it doesn’t. Although that’s not a bad thing. Hollow knight held 
			mastery over the metroidvania genre, and while silksong is also a metroidvania, team cherry decided to put their focus elsewhere. 
			When I play silksong I feel like I’m playing Dark Souls, Hollow Knight edition. Most of the unlockables are mean, meant to put 
			you in dangerous spots with little reward, traps that lure you in and hold you in their clutches, the world is grim and unforgiving, 
			and the bosses are near impossible to overcome, but as you get better and overcome these bosses, as well as the cruel world you 
			find yourself in. You unlock glimmers of hope, new ways to play, and a newfound sense of accomplishment. Not the feeling of 
			adventure and exploration that hollow knight is known for.</p>
			
			<p>Similar to Hollow Knight, Silksong’s world is beautiful. Despite the bleak atmosphere, I was constantly amazed by everything 
			going on around me, in the background, in the enemies, in all of the NPC’s you get to speak to, and the sprinkles of lore found 
			throughout the game, the worldbuilding is phenomenal, and every time I enter a new area, I’m amazed at what I might discover. </p>
			
			<p>Silksong is not without flaws though, some bosses are more unfair than difficult and the need to run back to the boss every 
			time you lose makes some bosses more aggravating than exciting. Some form of waypoint that only activates if you die to a boss, 
			as well as bigger rewards for beating some bosses would be appreciated, although not necessary. Regardless, Silksong is a game 
			that I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to anyone looking for a difficult game. </p>
