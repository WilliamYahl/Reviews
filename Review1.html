			<h1>Rain World</h1>
			<p> Rain world is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played. In this game, you get to play as a slugcat, a weak defenseless creature that feeds on the fruits and insects of the ecosystem that you find yourself lost in. This ecosystem is a long destroyed city full of deadly creatures that can kill you with minimal effort. There is no life bar or any way to survive an attack, You will simply die If you get caught. Your goal is to hoard food and survive the coming nights in order to eventually find your way out of this grand forest. </p>
			<p> The entirety of this game is built off of the ecosystem that you find yourself in. Aggressive creatures can be befriended, passive creatures become aggressive if you attack and eat them, and as you are exploring you will often find predators stalking other prey or even having territorial disputes with other predators. After a while of watching and living in this land, you get to understand the creatures around you and how to get by even the most dangerous of predators with ease. </p>
			<p> While the world itself is built to be as realistic and brutal as possible, the controls for the player are mostly unknown. There is no tutorial besides telling you how to walk and jump, with the rest of the movement designed to be discovered through experimentation. Forcing you to engage not only with the world around you as a weak child, just learning how to walk, but to also experiment and learn about how to move yourself. And when you discover a new option that you never knew you had, It feels rewarding and powerful, leaving you capable of new horizons. </p>
			<p> The visual presentation of the game is also beautiful, as you explore the ruins of a city that has already been taken over by the jungle around it, with a dark atmosphere from the caves and facilities beneath the city, to the breathtaking sights of the city above, of a great land that has been eroding away for centuries. All wrapped up by a torrential downpour of rain that at night can even be a deadly storm, crushing and drowning every living creature that has not found appropriate shelter. Even the land itself is trying to kill you at times. </p>
			<p> Lastly, I play a lot of RPG's, a lot of which are 100 to 200 hour games with vast worlds, new characters and people throughout all walks of life. Despite this, I have never once felt like the world was alive, since these people are stationary npc’s. You don’t see them living a day to day life, and you barely see their own personal life outside of what you need out of them. Rain world was the first game that I ever played where the world seemed alive and real. For that, I personally give rain world a 10/10 as one of the best games I’ve ever played. </p>
