			<h1> About Me. </h1>
			<p> Hello, I am William Yahl, and I have been playing video games throughout my entire life. While I like to play mostly Indie games, mostly including roguelikes and metroidvania. I also enjoy playing long, turn-based RPG’s and playing large open-world games, although those are few and far between.  </p>
			<p> Oftentimes when I play a video game, I’m looking for a consistent experience. All of my favourite games are trying to achieve something specific, and execute on it well. This could be the tone of the story, a well crafted environment, or even the ability to do anything, having the game be as free as possible. If it includes features and mechanics that can be easily ignored, or if it takes away from the overall experience, I’d consider that a major flaw in the game. </p>
			<p> I also like to take into consideration other aspects such as the artstyle, the polish of the game, and even the difficulty and overall Feel of the game itself. If pressing buttons and looking at the game as a whole doesn’t feel good in the first place, that is also a major flaw. </p>
